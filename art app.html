            <img src="./art app/IMG_1388.jpg">
            <p>I drew my drawing hand as it drew, so I didn't have to look back and forth between my artwork and my reference.</p>

            <h3>3 Value Viewfinder Sketch</h3>
            <img src="./art app/3 value viewfinder.png">
            <p>I did a 3 value sketch of various items, such as my keychain and an outlet, surrounded by my scrunched up sweater</p>

            <h3>Remixed Value Drawing
            </h3>
            <img src="./art app/Figure Drawing Remix (Apr 27, 2023 at 08_51).png">
            <p>For this we did several 20-minute figure drawings of various student models, and then picked one that we liked and remixed it with mixed-media elements. In my case I made heavy use of collage.</p>

            <h3>Paper Cup Sculpture Challenge</h3>

            <img class='productBack' src='./art app/paper cup 2.png'>
            <p>For this challenge, we were given 2 or 3 paper cups and tasked with transforming them into a sculpture that was unrecognizable as the original paper cups. I quite liked mine and I think it was the only one that's bouncy due to the way that its supports are designed.</p>

            <h3>Pop Art Print</h3>
            <img src="./art app/christ bumstead.jpg">
            <p>We had a mini unit on print making and pop art, and I (a non-christian) took inspiration from Jesus and made him buff using a reference of 4 time Olympia winner Chris Bumstead, which allowed me to title it with the pun Christ Bumstead.</p>
